Arduino Uno R4 Wifi used for testing

There are two pictures uploaded of the website

Sensor Data tracked over time displaying Today's data (every 30 minutes)

and Yesterday's data

Yesterday's data doesn't show up until it exists.

At midnight, the system pulls the time from the web and transfers data over to yesterday's graph

Google Charts JS library used in the HTML

I referenced the Arduino website for Wifi and RTC code and took off from there.
