# Arduino Sensor Data Logging

- Arduino Uno R4 Wifi used for testing

- There are two pictures uploaded of the website

- Sensor Data tracked over time displaying Today's data (every 30 minutes) and Yesterday's data

- Yesterday's data doesn't show up until it exists.

- At midnight, the system pulls the time from the web and transfers data over to yesterday's graph

- Check the Serial Monitor on the Arduino IDE for troubleshooting or status messages

**Credits**

- Google Charts JS library used in the HTML

- *I referenced the Arduino website for Wifi and RTC code and took off from there.*

- Temperature sensor math provided by Elegoo.com

**Parts Needed**

(1) x Arduino board with Wifi Capability like the Uno R4
(1) x 10k ohm resistor
(1) x Thermistor Rated for 10K Ohm Resistor
